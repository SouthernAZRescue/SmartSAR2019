# SmartSAR2019

This is the current live website at portal.sarci.org. It is not intended for mainstream use, but is posted as it has the ability to display the webcams at the SARA House.

This codebase was part of a development process that was halted in 2019 and is no longer maintained, except some planned vulnerability and broken link fixes in the near future. There is no confidential or private data on the site that requires protection.

As of summer 2022 the camera links are broken due to a change in the IP addressing schema at the SARA House.
