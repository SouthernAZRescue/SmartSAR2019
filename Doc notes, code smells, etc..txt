Why use GUIDs for aggregate root IDs?
- I'm aware of the side effects of GUIDs, namely the database paging issues, but I 
    needed a way to generate object IDs for domain events BEFORE the database commit. 
    Domain events are handled before the database commit to enable saving the side 
    effects as part of the same transaction, therefore I'm unable to rely on using
    the int ID assigned by the persistence framework as it is generated later (without
    alot of working around the ORM). To get around this every aggregate root has a 
    GUID ID assigned when it is constructed.
